# JavaScript

#Mini tasks 1-9 (uncomment appropriate to run)

1. Checking for leap years for years in array
2. Calculate factorial of 7
3. Calculate the sum of the odd items from array
4. Choose highest and lowest values from the given array. One loop run only
5. Choose longest string from the given array
6. Choose all the indexes of the highest value from the given array
7. Calculate average value from the given array for even numbers
8. Calculate average value of items at even indexes. Zero is not considered to be even number
9. With a given start value of 0. Iterate the array and add even items and subtract odd ones

#Mini tasks 10-22 (uncomment appropriate to run)

10. Function that returns the sum of all elements passed in array as parameter. Function (array)=>number
11. Function that returns sum of first and last elements of given array
12. Function that takes a number and return factorial of that number
13. Function that returns given array in reverse order //no build in functions
14. Function that based on given array returns new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e,f] -> [a+b, c+d, e+f]
15. Removed last element from the given array. Function that based on given array return new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e] -> [a+b, c+d, e+e]
16. Function that return one random element from given array
17. Function that takes two parameters: array and number off attempts. Based on number of attempts choose a random number from table that many times and return lowest one
18. Function that takes given array. Then takes a random element, removes it from the array and pushes it to result arrays. This takes place as long as there are elements in source array.
19. Function that on given array will perform operation of adding or subtracting elements. Operation is to be chosen at random. And return a result.[a,b,c,d] =>(((a+-b)+-c)+-d)
20. Function that return the current day name in Polish
21. Function that tells how many days till Friday
22. Function that take two numbers and return the object with 4 fields. Result on 4 basic arithmetic operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23. Iffe that returns an object with fields: function setValue(), function showValue() and function reverseValue(). Calling functions either logs the value or reverse it in an object. If value was not provided yet or is empty showValue function is to return information about that. Value can be type string or number. reverseValue():  If number do (*(-1)), if string reverse it.  Closure pattern.

24. Four function definitions. One for each basic math operation and taking two input parameters. Additional one that returns a calculated object containing the parameters object field (which contains two operation parameters inside (x and y)), and a function field (pointing to a function with a mathematical operation defined at the beginning). The setOperation () function sets a field and a computation function () that performs computations and returns a value

25. Array of objects and sum() function in context of each one of them. Sum function from this object  	

26 Reversed string function

27 Reversed number and sum function

28 Based on included JSON file. Returned Json from the file. Created a structures to hold data from the file. Created object that giving data about:

 - How much money was spend in 2014
 - What company was earning how much
 - What type on transaction was having what spending’s.
 - Values of the spending in each month
 - Values of the spending in each day of the week
