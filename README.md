5. Choose longest string from the given array
6. Choose all the indexes of the highest value from the given array
7. Calculate average value from the given array for even numbers
8. Calculate average value of items at even indexes. Zero is not considered to be even number

#Mini tasks 10-22 (uncomment appropriate to run)

10. Function that returns the sum of all elements passed in array as parameter. Function (array)=>number
11. Function that returns sum of first and last elements of given array
12. Function that takes a number and return factorial of that number
13. Function that returns given array in reverse order //no build in functions
14. Function that based on given array returns new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e,f] -> [a+b, c+d, e+f]
15. Removed last element from the given array. Function that based on given array return new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e] -> [a+b, c+d, e+e]
16. Function that return one random element from given array
17. Function that takes two parameters: array and number off attempts. Based on number of attempts choose a random number from table that many times and return lowest one
18. Function that takes given array. Then takes a random element, removes it from the array and pushes it to result arrays. This takes place as long as there are elements in source array.
19. Function that on given array will perform operation of adding or subtracting elements. Operation is to be chosen at random. And return a result.[a,b,c,d] =>(((a+-b)+-c)+-d)
20. Function that return the current day name in Polish
21. Function that tells how many days till Friday
22. Function that take two numbers and return the object with 4 fields. Result on 4 basic arithmetic operations
